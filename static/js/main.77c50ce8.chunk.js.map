Above is a very tedious and unpractical way of doing so.\r\n            My thinking right now is to achieve 3D, you need to fake it like you would in an illustration.

However, that does not mean I want to shy away from creating a 3D experience. I would like to incorporate effects such as parallax to cheat the 3D affect. For my final project I hope to create a 3D feeling without needing to build a ‘real’ 3D space.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n            </div>\r\n        )\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n","import React, { Component } from 'react'\r\n\r\nexport default class Pet_Experiment extends Component {\r\n    render() {\r\n        return (\r\n            <div>\r\n                <h1>This is the Pet Experiment</h1>\r\n            </div>\r\n        )\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n","import React, { Component } from 'react'\r\nimport backGroundImage from '../../../assets/Background-2.png';\r\nimport '../../../styles/Blog.css';\r\nexport default class Blog_CR_Ji_Yong_Park extends Component {\r\n    render() {\r\n        return (\r\n            <div  className=\"BGI\" style={{ backgroundImage: `url(${backGroundImage})`}}>\r\n            <div id=\"Blog-ContentArea\">\r\n  <div id=\"PageHeader\">\r\n    <h2 id=\"Blog-Heading\">Critical Analysis of <i>Design Principles for Interactive user experience through net art</i> by Ji Yong Park</h2>\r\n  </div> \r\n\r\n  <div id=\"BlogContentArea\">\r\n  <p>This paper is a discussion of the ways a user interacts with the immaterial space of a website. Highlighted these principles through the lens of <i>Net Art</i>. Analysing the art form and extracting the interactive principles that make a user’s experience on any site.</p>\r\n  <p>The paper begins by establishing that Net Art exists in this ‘temporary autonomous zone’ that is anarchical and spontaneous. Meaning that it exists outside the standard art convention sphere. Establishing it has a different relationship with its viewers as it is existing outside the mediated capitalism influence and is in a constant state of change.</p>\r\n  <p>The article highlights four properties that Net Art has highlighted through its challenging of preconceived notions of what the web is. These being: <i> Invisible design elements, Collaborative participation, Anarchic structure, and Non-linear communication. </i></p>\r\n  <p><i>Invisible design elements</i>, discusses how the Net Art uses the invisible properties, such as code, to construct its code. This new form of art creation allows new ways of self-expression and art that can only exist on the Net.</p>\r\n  <p><i>Collaborative Participation</i>, is the breakdown between creator and user. Where the artwork encourages active participation from the user in the creation of the art. Net art has ‘users’ and not ‘viewers.’ The mere act of users actively interacting with the Net Art is part of the process of creating that Net Art. </p>\r\n  <p><i>Anarchic Structure</i> established that Net Art exists outside the ‘Capital’ needed to create ‘offline art’. This leads to a system where the user is the artist, curator, and audience all at once. Allowing users to partake in an anarchist system in creating a formless being through interaction and reconstruction/deconstruction.</p>\r\n  <p><i>Non-Linear communication</i> describes how the Net Art contains an ever-changing data set that really belongs to no one. Where no one can ‘own’ the piece of art as it is ever-changing through the interactive process of its existence.</p>\r\n  <p>The article concludes that Net Art is all about <i>Interactivity</i>, letting users interact with other users through being an active participant in the creation of a piece of art. Establishing that the user experience is the culmination of these points.</p>\r\n  <p>I believe that this article’s analytical breakdown of the properties of Net Art is accurate. I struggle with a few points the paper is making. </p>\r\n  <p>Firstly, I understand the purpose of this paper to be to use Net Art to identify how users interact with the internet. To me,co it feels sort of counterproductive to try to apply these user-centred design principles to the ‘standard’ way of using the internet. When they were established through a system that goes against the ‘standard way’.</p>\r\n  <p>Secondly, I disagree with the Anarchical structure that states that Net Art exists outside the ‘Capital’ nature of other art forms. A user may not be limited by the ‘material costs’ of paint or clay but they are limited to technological costs. A person cannot will a website into being without ‘capital’ to buy a machine that can create Net Art. Basically, I do not believe that Net Art exists outside of the need for ‘capital’ to make itself.</p>\r\n<p>But overall, I do agree with most things that paper is saying. It has taken an analytical approach of breaking down a phenomena ‘Net Art’ and used it to help explain how to create a better user experience.</p>\r\n\r\n          <p>GOOBER</p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n        )\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n","import React, { Component } from 'react'\r\nimport backGroundImage from '../../../assets/Background-2.png';\r\nimport '../../../styles/Blog.css';\r\nexport default class Blog_CR_McNamara extends Component {\r\n    render() {\r\n        return (\r\n            <div  className=\"BGI\" style={{ backgroundImage: `url(${backGroundImage})`}}>\r\n            <div id=\"Blog-ContentArea\">\r\n  <div id=\"PageHeader\">\r\n    <h2 id=\"Blog-Heading\">RIP Adobe Flash Five Takeaways About the Plug-in’ - McNamara 2020</h2>\r\n  </div> \r\n\r\n  <div id=\"BlogContentArea\">\r\n  <p>Full disclosure on my part, I am not sure if this article counts as one of the close reading materials provided for use to analyse, however, it was short, and I am pressed for time right now. If it does not constitute as one, I will just do an extra one later.</p>\r\n    <p>This web article is written as a sort of eulogy for Flash and a call to action for artists who have created with Flash to preserve their digital work on open-source archival sites. The author who attended a talk that served as a goodbye to Flash. Talking to artist activists about what their main takeaways from flash were.</p>\r\n    <p>The author highlights five major points about the open source creative tool:</p>\r\n    <ul>\r\n        <li>Its influence on web aesthetics in the early 2000’s</li>\r\n        <li>How web standardization through social media killed it</li>\r\n        <li>How flash can be preserved today</li>\r\n        <li>How open-source sites like Cornifer help smaller artists or groups</li>\r\n        <li>There is limited space on Cornifer so maybe use another site if desperate.</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n    <p>My main takeaways from this article mainly concerns the first three points, so I will explore them in more depth. To begin with Flash became a tool or artistic expression over the internet, people could animate, make games or interactive experiences, or just experiment to see what they could do. </p> \r\n    <p>It was this thing that was accessible to people outside of traditional artistic institutions, where people had the freedom to experiment and learn and master what they wanted to. It was a wild west of creation, greatly impacting what the ‘internet’ looked and functioned like.</p>\r\n    <p>Then the standardisations came along, with the internet shifting to social media platforms being the main access point of the internet for a wave of new people, this gave those major platforms the power to influence people’s expectations of what the internet was. This coupled with the fact that mobile devices were created not supporting Flash lead to a decline in its ‘relevance’ for the overall internet. The author highlights a caveat to Flash as a creation tool, the fact that is not owned by most people that use. If the owners of Flash decided to take it down (which they did) they own the right to do that and suddenly artists who learnt how to create in the medium have lost access to their tools.</p>\r\n    <p>The final point I want to touch upon about this is the archival of art created in Flash by NGO’s such as Cornifer. These sorts of archival programs are run by smaller groups or artists that don’t want Flash’s history to be lost. Allowing people today to still access Flash works once Flash is gone and no more creation with it can be done. I think these sorts of efforts are good and necessary, forgetting about the history for Flash means that a potential use for the internet is lost. Potentially homogenising how the internet is consumed, leading to a more capitalised internet lead by major corporations or conglomerates.</p>\r\n    <p>Final thoughts, Adobe Flash happened, it existed, and its impact still resonates with people today. Preserving this piece of internet history is vitally important for future people to understand what the internet once was and what its potential really is.

This piece of <i>Text Art</i> or ASCII art depicts a horse created using text symbols, however it has one catch, the horse never ends.</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n        I believe that tis piece of internet art is a perfect example of an artwork that only exists because of an innate internet functionality and unique symbols created for computer functionality. This artwork is a depiction of a horse using text symbols found on keyboards but as the user uses the scroll function of the website, the horses’ legs get longer. Creating a horse that is as long as a webpage, effectively infinitely long.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n        I want to focus on the constraints this artwork was created with first. Endless Horse is a constructed drawing of a horse made entirely from text symbols used on the keyboard. What draws me to this drawing is the fact that it is created within such a strong constraint, the artist had to fight for every angle and curve to construct a recognisable horse. The artist effectively typed the image they wanted to draw, removing the initial usage of each symbol and substituting it to convey ‘hair’, ‘eyes’, or ‘legs.’ This sort of bending the unique to computer created artworks, with the closest analogue to this I can think about being collages. \r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n        Although the horse’s construction is impressive, I believe it isn’t what makes this artwork a piece of ‘internet art’. The work takes a fundamental function of the internet and utilised to make a funny gag. This functionality being the ‘infinite scrolling’ of a website. The scroll feature tends to be this vitally integrated feature of a website, for when all the information cannot fit onto one screen, instead of turning a page for instance, website just have more space downwards. This piece of internet art makes me acutely aware of how much ‘space’ websites have at their disposal, the longer and more ridiculous the horse gets, the more and more I realise how vast this online ‘space’ can be. \r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n        This artwork reminds me of trying to get to the end of an excel spreadsheet, an activity I did multiple times as a young lad. I would scroll and scroll ad scroll and the scroll bar on the side of screen just got smaller and smaller but to no avail, I never got to that last cell. Imagining all the possible ‘space’ to store information is astonishing and something I cannot fully wrap my head around.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>Alex Carvalho, 1847332</p> \r\n  </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n        )\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/Idirect flight.29fd6486.png\";","import React, { Component } from 'react'\r\nimport backGroundImage from '../../../assets/Background-2.png';\r\nimport '../../../styles/Blog.css';\r\nimport BlogIMG from '../../../assets/Idirect flight.png';\r\nexport default class Blog_AR_Indirect_Flights extends Component {\r\n    render() {\r\n        return (\r\n            <div  className=\"BGI\" style={{ backgroundImage: `url(${backGroundImage})`}}>\r\n            <div id=\"Blog-ContentArea\">\r\n  <div id=\"PageHeader\">\r\n    <h2 id=\"Blog-Heading\">Indirect Flights, 2015 by Joe Hamilton and Art using the internet</h2>\r\n  </div> \r\n\r\n  <div id=\"BlogContentArea\">\r\n  <p>I found Indirect Flights to be a mesmerising and tranquil experience.

Where the more I explore the more hidden secrets I find that wasn't there before.</p>\r\n    <p>This piece functions like a collage made from raw materials, satellite images, organic textures, brush strokes and architectural fragments. Where the viewer can endless pan the scene and see the floating images pass by. With the images panning at different rates to fake depth. </p>\r\n    <p>The creator that this piece of internet art depicts a landscape that has been defined through the modern era of digital technologies and global interrelations.

This artwork, that is effectivly a massive collage, could be created tangibly. Uses the same photographs and materials used in Indirect Flights, however, this tangible version would lack some qualities provided by the online medium. </p>\r\n    <p>This piece is inherently interactive, where the magic of this work happens in motion. The viewer is encouraged to explore the seemingly endless space, following whatever catches their eye. Using a web page to display this work allows the piece to be hidden, as some images may be hidden under others or the whole image is not the same size as the screen space. This sort of behaviour is only possible on a web page. As it gives the functionality the piece needs as well as giving the viewer agency in how they view the piece.</p>\r\n    <p>This art piece uses the internet as its source of images to populate the piece and could not exist in its current form without the internet’s functionality.

The intention for this is because I plan to redo this design later on once I can integrate react.js with the website.</p>\r\n    <p>But breaking down this design. I separated the website into two regions “menu” (blue) and “content” (Red). The ‘menu area’ being populated with interactive buttons that facilitate the website’s navigation and takes up a column on the left side of the screen. The ‘content area’ populated with the relevant content I want to show for the page. This is situated in a wider column to the right of the “menu area” Below is a diagram of the layout. </p>\r\n    <p>Noted: Included in the “content area” is a sub-area (Yellow) that is dedicated to titles if necessary for the page.</p>\r\n    <img id=\"AR_1_IMG\" alt=\"The general layout of the site at the time\" src={BlogImage}/>\r\n    <p>Colour: Because I do not plan on keeping this style, I kept my colour choices pretty simple. Using mainly blacks, greys and whites but I did make the blog buttons blue to test how my button design would work using actual colour. </p>\r\n    <p>This moves me onto the Buttons. They are big, fat, clearly labelled and have a little bit of animation to them that shows interaction. Basically, they are everything I like in a basic started button. The CSS for them is straightforward and I saved time making them simple to work on other aspects of the sight.</p>\r\n    <p>Surprisingly I like this “clean” or “clinical” look to the site. Don’t get me wrong, it is not appealing and probably shouldn’t be the final look for any website. It does, however, allow to focus on the other aesthetic elements of the sights without cluttering the page or taking too much time away from other elements. Keeping it simple for now to be improved on for later is what I feel this ‘style’ is.</p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n        )\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/Labeled-Colour-Swatch.556953c2.png\";","import React, { Component } from 'react'\r\nimport backGroundImage from '../../../assets/Background-2.png';\r\nimport '../../../styles/Blog.css';\r\nimport BlogImage from '../../../assets/Labeled-Colour-Swatch.png';\r\n\r\nexport default class Blog_AR_2 extends Component {\r\n    render() {\r\n        return (\r\n            <div  className=\"BGI\" style={{ backgroundImage: `url(${backGroundImage})`}}>\r\n            <div id=\"Blog-ContentArea\">\r\n  <div id=\"PageHeader\">\r\n    <h2 id=\"Blog-Heading\">A little progress in the right direction, Artistic Reflection 08/11/2021</h2>\r\n    </div> \r\n\r\n        <div id=\"BlogContentArea\">\r\n        <p>The overall theme I want to go for is <i>Space</i>, I want the space of my website to incoke the feeling of being in space.

This website does not include any of it. The website in its current form is technically very simple as it is predominantly made from Html and CSS and includes no JavaScript. This simplicity is born out of necessity as I have struggled to get React.js and GitHub to work together. I do plan to basically rebuild the website once I can integrate the two technologies. </p>\r\n    <p>For now, though, the website functions as this simplistic skeleton, that while it does include some navigation functionality doesn’t offer much else. This is mainly due to time pressures and my issues with getting a grip on react.js. </p>\r\n    <p>In terms of styling, I have used simple CSS properties such as Gridbox and Flexbox to construct the page layout. Then using other CSS properties to manipulate the presentation of other screen elements.</p>\r\n    <p>This current iteration of the site is sort of like a developer prototype technically. It is constructed just enough to get the idea across, but it is by no means robust. A lot of styling and structure is “fine for this time”. For example, while elements have some responsive design to them, for example, regions are not based on fixed sizes but do scale. This a robust system it does not make. A final website would need additional styling codes for different aspect ratios, visual impairments, and other niche scenarios. </p>\r\n    <p>My current site does not have these features as I have chosen to omit them in the favour of time management and the understanding that I will be rebuilding this site later. </p>\r\n    <p>A small note on how I created my piece of <i>Internet Art</i>. I began by setting an area of the screen to be an edited screenshot of the ‘Cat’ Wikipedia page. Then I placed a paragraph element in a specific position that worked for my screen display. I have a string variable that contains the text I will populate the page with. An event listener checks if the user is typing, then runs a function that slowly adds texts to the screen element.</p>\r\n    <p>The issue with this current artwork is that it should break with other displays. However, I did not feel it was an important issue to fix considering this is a temporary piece of art. It was fun to make, and I am happy with how it turned out.</p>\r\n    <p>Overall, <i>Technically</i>, this sight is simple but effective in showcasing what a functioning site could look like. While nothing fancy is going on, it showcases the barebones needed to create a functioning website.</p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n        )\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n","import React, { Component } from 'react'\r\nimport backGroundImage from '../../../assets/Background-2.png';\r\nimport '../../../styles/Blog.css';\r\n\r\nexport default class Blog_TR_2 extends Component {\r\n    render() {\r\n        return (\r\n            <div  className=\"BGI\" style={{ backgroundImage: `url(${backGroundImage})`}}>\r\n            <div id=\"Blog-ContentArea\">\r\n  <div id=\"PageHeader\">\r\n    <h2 id=\"Blog-Heading\">I am not happy with it, Technical Reflection as of 08/11/2021</h2>\r\n  </div> \r\n\r\n  <div id=\"BlogContentArea\">\r\n  <p>\r\n        Let’s begin by addressing the lack of the big fat elephant in the room. There is no React.JS on the website currently. Why? Well to put it simply I ran out of time, panicked, and stuck to what I knew. I have been busy with a lot stuff outside of IM and by the time I could devote time to this assignment I realised I was going to fail if I had to try and learn how to use React.JS whilst still trying to build the website. Frankly I feel I still failed. \r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n        The Pet-Experiment, my next internet artwork never got made. The plans and idea are there but I could not devote the time needed to make it whilst there was still a whole website to build. This is also a failure on my part.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n        So, what technically speaking did I succeed in? Frankly I believe it is just my navigation bar. I created a dropdown navigation bar and that is about it. That is all that is technically different from last assignment and this one. Whoop de doo.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n        I wanted to try and make sure the sight works on more form factors than just my monitor. So where I could I have tried to keep setting fixed pixel sized to a minimum and mainly rely on adaptive scale values like % and vW. I would have like to include proper form factor coding but I did not have the time to do so.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n        )\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n","import './App.css';\nimport Navbar from './components/Navbar';\nimport { Switch ,Route } from 'react-router-dom';\nimport Home from './pages/Home';\nimport Footer from './components/Footer';\nimport Menu from './pages/Menu';\nimport About from './pages/About';\n\nimport Text_Experiment from './pages/Internert Art/Text_Experiment';\nimport ThreeD_Experiment from './pages/Internert Art/ThreeD_Experiment';\nimport Pet_Experiment from './pages/Internert Art/Pet_Experiment';\n\nimport Blog_CR_Ji_Yong_Park from './pages/Blog/Close Readings/Blog_CR_Ji_Yong_Park';\nimport Blog_CR_McNamara from './pages/Blog/Close Readings/Blog_CR_McNamara';\nimport Blog_AR_Endless_Horse from './pages/Blog/Internet Art Reflection/Blog_AR_Endless_Horse';\nimport Blog_AR_Indirect_Flights from './pages/Blog/Internet Art Reflection/Blog_AR_Indirect_Flights' \nimport Blog_AR_1 from './pages/Blog/Reflection-Artistic/Blog_AR_1';\nimport Blog_AR_2 from './pages/Blog/Reflection-Artistic/Blog_AR_2';\nimport Blog_TR_1 from './pages/Blog/Reflection-Technical/Blog_TR_1';\nimport Blog_TR_2 from './pages/Blog/Reflection-Technical/Blog_TR_2';\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"App\">\n      <Navbar/>\n      <Switch>\n        <Route exact path='/' component={Home}/>\n        <Route exact path='/menu' component={Menu}/>\n        <Route exact path='/about' component={About}/>\n    \n        <Route exact path='/Internet_Art/Text_Experiment' component={Text_Experiment}/>\n        <Route exact path='/Internet_Art/3D_Experiment' component={ThreeD_Experiment}/>\n        <Route exact path='/Internet_Art/Pet_Experiment' component={Pet_Experiment}/>\n\n        <Route exact path='/Blog/Close-Reading/Ji_Yong_Park' component={Blog_CR_Ji_Yong_Park}/>\n        <Route exact path='/Blog/Close-Reading/McNamara' component={Blog_CR_McNamara}/>\n        <Route exact path='/Blog/Art-Reflection/Enless_Horse' component={Blog_AR_Endless_Horse}/>\n        <Route exact path='/Blog/Art-Reflection/Indirect_Flights' component={Blog_AR_Indirect_Flights}/>\n        <Route exact path='/Blog/Reflection-Artistic/01-10-2021' component={Blog_AR_1}/>\n        <Route exact path='/Blog/Reflection-Artistic/08-11-2021' component={Blog_AR_2}/>\n        <Route exact path='/Blog/Reflection-Technical/01-10-2021' component={Blog_TR_1}/>\n        <Route exact path='/Blog/Reflection-Technical/08-11-2021' component={Blog_TR_2}/>\n      </Switch>\n      <Footer/>\n\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n","const reportWebVitals = onPerfEntry => {\n  if (onPerfEntry && onPerfEntry instanceof Function) {\n    import('web-vitals').then(({ getCLS, getFID, getFCP, getLCP, getTTFB }) => {\n      getCLS(onPerfEntry);\n      getFID(onPerfEntry);\n      getFCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getLCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getTTFB(onPerfEntry);\n    });\n  }\n};\n\nexport default reportWebVitals;\n","import React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\nimport App from './App';\nimport reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals';\nimport {BrowserRouter} from 'react-router-dom';\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  <React.StrictMode>\n    <BrowserRouter>\n      <App />\n    </BrowserRouter>\n  </React.StrictMode>,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n);\n\n\nreportWebVitals();\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
