  </div> 

  <div id="BlogContentArea">
  <p>This paper is a discussion of the ways a user interacts with the immaterial space of a website. Highlighted these principles through the lens of <i>Net Art</i>. Analysing the art form and extracting the interactive principles that make a user’s experience on any site.</p>
  <p>The paper begins by establishing that Net Art exists in this ‘temporary autonomous zone’ that is anarchical and spontaneous. Meaning that it exists outside the standard art convention sphere. Establishing it has a different relationship with its viewers as it is existing outside the mediated capitalism influence and is in a constant state of change.</p>
  <p>The article highlights four properties that Net Art has highlighted through its challenging of preconceived notions of what the web is. These being: <i> Invisible design elements, Collaborative participation, Anarchic structure, and Non-linear communication. </i></p>
  <p><i>Invisible design elements</i>, discusses how the Net Art uses the invisible properties, such as code, to construct its code. This new form of art creation allows new ways of self-expression and art that can only exist on the Net.</p>
  <p><i>Collaborative Participation</i>, is the breakdown between creator and user. Where the artwork encourages active participation from the user in the creation of the art. Net art has ‘users’ and not ‘viewers.’ The mere act of users actively interacting with the Net Art is part of the process of creating that Net Art. </p>
  <p><i>Anarchic Structure</i> established that Net Art exists outside the ‘Capital’ needed to create ‘offline art’. This leads to a system where the user is the artist, curator, and audience all at once. Allowing users to partake in an anarchist system in creating a formless being through interaction and reconstruction/deconstruction.</p>
  <p><i>Non-Linear communication</i> describes how the Net Art contains an ever-changing data set that really belongs to no one. Where no one can ‘own’ the piece of art as it is ever-changing through the interactive process of its existence.</p>
  <p>The article concludes that Net Art is all about <i>Interactivity</i>, letting users interact with other users through being an active participant in the creation of a piece of art. Establishing that the user experience is the culmination of these points.</p>
  <p>I believe that this article’s analytical breakdown of the properties of Net Art is accurate. I struggle with a few points the paper is making. </p>
  <p>Firstly, I understand the purpose of this paper to be to use Net Art to identify how users interact with the internet. To me,co it feels sort of counterproductive to try to apply these user-centred design principles to the ‘standard’ way of using the internet. When they were established through a system that goes against the ‘standard way’.</p>
  <p>Secondly, I disagree with the Anarchical structure that states that Net Art exists outside the ‘Capital’ nature of other art forms. A user may not be limited by the ‘material costs’ of paint or clay but they are limited to technological costs. A person cannot will a website into being without ‘capital’ to buy a machine that can create Net Art. Basically, I do not believe that Net Art exists outside of the need for ‘capital’ to make itself.</p>
<p>But overall, I do agree with most things that paper is saying. It has taken an analytical approach of breaking down a phenomena ‘Net Art’ and used it to help explain how to create a better user experience.</p>
